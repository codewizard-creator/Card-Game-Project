# Card-Game-Project


The opponent is the computer and you start having a total of 5 cards.

The cards ' values are randomly generated from 1 to 4.

Currently, there are 4 different types of cards available in the game. But before we move on to its explanations lets look at endgane

the endgame is pretty simple. If the sum of the values of your cards you play exceeds that of your opponent

you'd have won.If there are 9 or more cards in the place, the game ends at the end of the round.

1. Scout

Makes one of the cards in the opponent's hand visible. The opponent cannot play that card in that hand.

2.Companion

Comrade card if the sum of the values in the opponent's hand is greater than in your hand, that card
a companion card with an excess value is formed next to it.

3. Risk card

At the end of the hand, the value of the risk card increases from 1 to 5. If it is larger than 8, it will return to its original state
and it falls into the hands of the opponent.
